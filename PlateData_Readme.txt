Each plate data takes one row. 
The resolution of the program is 0.1 mm. (You can hack it to 0.025 mm though, which is the resolution of the stepper motor rail.)

The six columns are:
0:	x coordinate of the top-left well group, in mm
1:	y coordinate ~
2:	well group x pitch, in mm
3:	well group y ~
4:	how many groups on each row (x direction)
5:	how many groups on each column (y direction)
6:	comment, showing up in the program
